how to make 2d case working after fix the k-space issue


1 create a excitation pulse in the pulse.cuh and pulse.cu(RFflip_EXC)

2 change the excitation pulse in GRE sequence by RFflip_EXC

3 in sequence,cuh line 176 to line 186 chenged the G +=pulse[pulse_num]->out(time,0,r,0); (it reduced the preformence of the program)



note: for some reson the single precision only work for pulse lenth greater than 0.5ms

why not working for double precison?
